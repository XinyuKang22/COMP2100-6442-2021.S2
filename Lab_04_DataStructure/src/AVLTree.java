/**
 * Welcome! Make sure to check out 'readme.md' for a rundown of requirements/description of this implementation
 * that may differ from normal implementations. Before starting, it may also be worth checking out Tree.java
 * and BinarySearchTree.java as all method description is contained in the superclass unless edited. For
 * example: the description for 'insert' cannot be found here. It is in the superclass!
 * <p>
 * Please note that you may edit this class as much as you like (i.e.,create helper methods if you want!).
 * So long as you genuinely pass the tests (i.e., do not change existing methods signatures). Ask questions if you are
 * lost or unsure.
 * You SHALL NOT edit any other classes.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, if you are looking to better visualise the results of your insertion, you are free print the contents
 * of the method '.display()' (found in Tree.java which class, AVLTree, extends through BinarySearchTree). This
 * method will provide you with a graphical representation of the tree.
